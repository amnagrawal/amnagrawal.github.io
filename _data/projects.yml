- name: Twitter Network Analysis
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: Twitter-Network
  img: /images/twitter.jpg
  active-link: True
  desc: Extracts a network of a subset of Twitter users (100-500), and reports the analysis on the extracted data 

    + Run a web-crawler to get a list of NBA players, which form the required network.

    + Fetch twitter accounts and relevant data using Twitter-API

    + Perform network analysis.  

- name: Brexit Tweets Classification
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: TweetClassifier-WeakSupervision
  img: /images/twitter.jpg
  active-link: False
  desc: Developed classification of Brexit-related tweets using weak social supervision with only 10% of the labeled data. Used Snorkel for weak supervision and added unlabeled tweets for classification in addition to labeled tweets. Improved classifier accuracy by nearly 15%.

- name: Active Contour Fitting
  img: /images/active-contour.jpg
  desc: Perform Fitting using Active Contours to detect edges of an object in an image.

- name: Image calibration
  img: /images/3dcalib.jpg
  desc: Calibrate 3D World points with the 2D image points.

    + Extract feature points from the calibration target and show them on the image

    + Compute the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera

    + Implement RANSAC for robust estimation of the camera parameters

- name: Image Style Transfer
  img: /images/image_style_transfer.jpg
  desc: Create a unique artistic image by composing two images where the new image will have content of one image and style of the other image.

- name: Playing Atari Games using Deep Reinforcement Learning
  img: /images/atari.gif
  desc: Implemented this research paper on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Implemented a convolution neural network for deep-Q network and linearly annealed epsilon-greedy policy to train the model to play Breakout and Space Invaders on OpenAI-Gym environment.
