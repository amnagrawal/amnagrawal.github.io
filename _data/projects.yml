- name: Twitter Network Analysis
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: Twitter-Network
  img: /images/graph.svg
  active-link: True
  desc: Extracts a network of a subset of Twitter users (100-500), and reports the analysis on the extracted data 

    + Run a web-crawler to get a list of NBA players, which form the required network.

    + Fetch twitter accounts and relevant data using Twitter-API

    + Perform network analysis.  

- name: Brexit Tweets Classification
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: TweetClassifier-WeakSupervision
  img: /images/twitter.jpg
  active-link: True
  desc: Developed classification of Brexit-related tweets using weak social supervision with only 10% of the labeled data. Used Snorkel for weak supervision and added unlabeled tweets for classification in addition to labeled tweets. Improved classifier accuracy by nearly 15%.

- name: Active Contour Fitting
  img: /images/active-contour.jpg
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: Active-contour-fitting
  active-link: True
  desc: Perform Fitting using Active Contours to detect edges of an object in an image.

- name: Image calibration
  img: /images/3dcalib.jpg
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: 3D-Image-Calibration
  active-link: True
  desc: Calibrate 3D World points with the 2D image points.

    + Extract feature points from the calibration target and show them on the image

    + Compute the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera

    + Implement RANSAC for robust estimation of the camera parameters

- name: Image Style Transfer
  img: /images/image_style_transfer.jpg
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: Image-Style-Transfer
  active-link: True
  desc: Create a unique artistic image by composing two images where the new image will have content of one image and style of the other image.

- name: Human level control on Atari Games using Deep Reinforcement Learning
  img: /images/atari.gif
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: Atari-DQN
  active-link: True
  desc: Implemented [this](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning) research paper on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Implemented a convolution neural network for Deep Q-Network (DQN) and linearly annealed epsilon-greedy policy to train the model to play Breakout and Space Invaders on OpenAI-Gym environment.

- name: Music Generator using RNNs and RBMs
  img: /images/music.png
  desc: Developed a music generator trained on Nottingham dataset using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In order to account for time-delays between each notes played, each RNN unit is coupled with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The implementation used Keras with Theano backend to train the model on the GPU. By the end of the trianing, the model could produce good sounding music. 


- name: SVM Performance improvement
  img: /images/svm.png
  gh_user: amnagrawal
  repo: SVM-PSO
  active-link: true
  desc: Support Vector Machine Classifier primarily use two hyper-parameters which determine its performance. These are C and gamma. This project studied the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the optimum values of these hyper-parameters in the search space. PSO is a kind of evolutionary algorithm inspired from observing how in nature, the birds flock to find their food. 

- name: Chess-AI
  img: /images/chess.png
  desc: AI-bot to play chess using basic Minimax algorithm and Alpha-beta Pruning. In order to deal with the combinatorial explosion, only a few levels deep tree is studied. Deployed this model to an Android Application for easier evaluation. The bot intelligence increases at the deeper levels of the tree, but so does the time it takes to figure out the best move.
